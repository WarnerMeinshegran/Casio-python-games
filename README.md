## Games
### TicTacToe
a tictactoe game but for 2 players with no support for AI
I DIDNT MAKE THIS GAME I ONLY MADE IT COMPATIBLE WITH THE CALCULATOR.
*ORIGINAL VERSION*: www.askpython.com/python/examples/tic-tac-toe-using-python
### Game 1
Its simply rock paper scissors but with AI
### WhyCuz
Why because is a 2 player game with AI support.
How its played:
the first player needs to type a question that starts with why then pass 
it to the next player after pressing EXE.
the second player should write a answer that starts with becuase, 
without seeing the question.
finally both question and answer will be revealed
### Word predict
just like hangman in this game you have a certain amount of tries, your goal
is to guess the word.
This is the most updated game in this list
#### wordpredict mini
same as wordpredict compressed but:
-less words to guess
-no level system
-no updates
