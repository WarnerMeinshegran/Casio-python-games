# Casio-python-tools-and-games
Games and tools I made for my casio calculator fx-9860GIII.
## Games
### Game 1
Its simply rock paper scissors but with AI
### TicTacToe
a tictactoe game but for 2 players with no support for AI
I DIDNT MAKE THIS GAME I ONLY MADE IT COMPATIBLE WITH THE CALCULATOR
ORIGINAL VERSION: www.askpython.com/python/examples/tic-tac-toe-using-python
### WhyCuz
Why because is a 2 player game with AI support.
How its played:
the first player needs to type a question that starts with why then pass 
it to the next player after pressing EXE.
the second player should write a answer that starts with becuase, 
without seeing the question.
finally both question and answer will be revealed
### Word predict
just like hangman in this game you have a certain amount of tries, your goal
is to guess the word.There is a level system.
#### wordpredict compressed
its same as the previous game but is smaller by using a minfier
#### wordpredict mini
same as wordpredict compressed but:
-less words to guess
-no level system
-less updates
