# Casio-python-games
Games and tools I made for my casio calculator fx-9860GIII.
You can play these games on any calculator that supports python.

## Mini version of game
There are mini versions of some games, these versions focus on using the least space not the least cpu/ram usage.
Things to note when using mini versions:
- code is minified by a minifier which means the code will be hard to read
- some features are removed
- some feature are limited like for example wordpredict mini will have less word to guess

### RPS
Its simply rock paper scissors but you play with bot
### WhyCuz
Why because is a 2 player game with bots.
How its played:

Imitator, a 3+ player game
A player click the starts button and passes the calc to the said person(specified by game)
The reciving player clicks the EXE button and the game will choose if he

or if he knows what to talk about. this is repeated to all players.
The players ask questions to each others. the game will tell who to question whom.
Finally when the game finishes the players vote to who they think is imitating.
after voting the imitator will try to guess the subject they were talking about
