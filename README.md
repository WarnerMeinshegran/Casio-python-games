## Games
### TicTacToe
a tictactoe game but for 2 players with no support for AI
I DIDNT MAKE THIS GAME I ONLY MADE IT COMPATIBLE WITH THE CALCULATOR.
*ORIGINAL VERSION*: www.askpython.com/python/examples/tic-tac-toe-using-python
### Game 1
Its simply rock paper scissors but with AI
### WhyCuz
Why because is a 2 player game with AI support.
How its played:
the first player needs to type a question that starts with why then pass 
it to the next player after pressing EXE.
the second player should write a answer that starts with becuase, 
without seeing the question.
finally both question and answer will be revealed
### Word predict
just like hangman in this game you have a certain amount of tries, your goal
is to guess the word.
#### wordpredict mini
same as wordpredict but:
-less words to guess
-no level system
-no updates
-small size
### NumberGuess 
1-2 player game.
How to Play:
A mathmatical equation is given, you need to find the result of this equation to find the hidden number
This game's level system is not complete yet, but its playable
### Imitator
Imitator, a 3+ player game
A player click the starts button and passes the calc to the said person(specified by game)
The reciving player clicks the EXE button and the game will choose if he 
is the one that should imitate that he knows what are they talking about,
or if he knows what to talk about. this is repeated to all players.
The players ask questions to each others. the game will tell who to question whom.
Finally when the game finishes the players vote to who they think is imitating.
after voting the imitator will try to guess the subject they were talking about
#### ImitatorMini
same as imitator but the game is smaller in size and will have fewer updates


## Tools
### SDTcalc
calculates speed, time, and distance. not made by me, credits are in the code
### m2StdFrm
from slope form(y=mx+b) to standard form (x+y=b)
### TSA calc
calulate surface area and volume
currently only sphere bases are supported
