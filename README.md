# Casio-python-games
Games and tools I made for my casio calculator fx-9860GIII.
You can play these games on any calculator that supports python.

## Mini version of game
There are mini versions of some games, these versions focus on using the least space not the least cpu/ram usage.
Things to note when using mini versions:
- code is minified by a minifier which means the code will be hard to read
- some features are removed
- some feature are limited like for example wordpredict mini will have less word to guess

## News
Updated commands.py  
New file! commands.py  
Updated String_methodes.py library  
Updated UnoTerminal to 1.2

## Games
### RPS
Its simply rock paper scissors but you play with bot.
This is a replacment for game1 because it had 50 lines of code while RPS has only 11 lines of code
### WhyCuz
Why because is a 2 player game with bots.
How its played:
the first player needs to type a question that starts with why then pass 
it to the next player after pressing EXE.
the second player should write a answer that starts with becuase, 
without seeing the question.
finally both question and answer will be revealed
### Word predict
just like hangman in this game you have a certain amount of tries, your goal
is to guess the word.
#### wordpredict mini
same as wordpredict but:
-less words to guess
-no level system
-no updates
### NumberGuess 
1-2 player game.
How to Play:
A mathmatical equation is given, you need to find the result of this equation to find the hidden number
This game's level system is not complete yet, but its playable
### Imitator
Imitator, a 3+ player game
A player click the starts button and passes the calc to the said person(specified by game)
The reciving player clicks the EXE button and the game will choose if he 
is the one that should imitate that he knows what are they talking about,
or if he knows what to talk about. this is repeated to all players.
The players ask questions to each others. the game will tell who to question whom.
Finally when the game finishes the players vote to who they think is imitating.
after voting the imitator will try to guess the subject they were talking about
#### ImitatorMini
same as imitator but the game is smaller in size and will have no updates
### UnoTerminal
Play uno but in your calculator!
can be played alone with bots or with friends



## Tools
### m2StdFrm (Not maintained anymore, it is complete)
from slope form(y=mx+b) to standard form (x+y=b)
### TSA calc (Not maintained anymore)
calulate surface area and volume
currently only sphere bases are supported
### commands.py
A command line that can run one line code and multiline code!
Very useful for testing some code.
