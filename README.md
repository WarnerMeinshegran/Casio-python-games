### TicTacToe
a tictactoe game but for 2 players with no support for AI
I DIDNT MAKE THIS GAME I ONLY MADE IT COMPATIBLE WITH THE CALCULATOR.

Its simply rock paper scissors but with AI

Why because is a 2 player game with AI support.
How its played:
the first player needs to type a question that starts with why then pass 
it to the next player after pressing EXE.
the second player should write a answer that starts with becuase, 
without seeing the question.
